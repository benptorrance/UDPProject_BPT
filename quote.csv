Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.
Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live.
Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build bigger and better idiot-proof programs, and the Universe trying to produce bigger and better idiots. So far, the Universe is winning.
Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.
I am not a great programmer; I am just a good programmer with great habits.
That's the thing about people who think they hate computers. What they really hate is lousy programmers.
A language that does not affect the way you think about programming is not worth knowing.
Walking on water and developing software from a specification are easy if both are frozen.
Perl - The only language that looks the same before and after RSA encryption.
The most important property of a program is whether it accomplishes the intention of its user.
Computer Science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes. - Edsger W. Dijkstra
Computer science inverts the normal. In normal science, you're given a world, and your job is to find out the rules. In computer science, you give the computer the rules, and it creates the world. - Alan Kay
The question of whether a computer can think is no more interesting than the question of whether a submarine can swim. - Edsger W. Dijkstra
People think that computer science is the art of geniuses but the actual reality is the opposite, just many people doing things that build on each other, like a wall of mini stones. - Donald Knuth.
It is easier to change the specification to fit the program than vice versa. - Alan J. Perlis
In a 5 year period we get one superb programming language. Only we can't control when the 5 year period will be. - Alan J. Perlis
We can only see a short distance ahead, but we can see plenty there that needs to be done. - Alan Turing
The cheapest, fastest, and most reliable components of a computer system are those that aren't there. -Gordon Bell
Premature optimization is the root of all evil in programming. - C.A.R. Hoare
To be a good professional engineer, always start to study late for exams. Because it teaches you how to manage time and tackle emergencies. - Bill Gates.
